#Photo Slideshow - Google Hashcode 2019 Problem - Online Round

###Introduction 
As the saying goes, "a picture is wo h a thousand words." We agree – photos are an 
impo ant pa of contemporary digital and cultural life. Approximately 2.5 billion 1  
people around the world carry a camera – in the form of a sma phone – in their 
pocket every day. We tend to make good use of it, too, taking more photos than ever 
(back in 2017, Google Photos announced it was backing up more than 1.2 billion photos 
and videos per day 2 ).  
 
The rise of digital photography creates an interesting challenge: what should we do 
with all of these photos? In this competition problem, we will explore the idea of 
composing a slideshow out of a photo collection. 

###Task 
Given a list of photos and the tags associated with each photo, arrange the photos into 
a slideshow that is as interesting as possible (the scoring section below explains what 
we mean by “interesting”). 

###Solution
Solution in code is the greedy approach. 
A baseline approach.   
TODO: Improve Greedy solution to add ordering based on how interesting
the transition can be. (Some common sets, and some not so common)
